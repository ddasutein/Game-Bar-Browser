# Game-Bar-Browser
A basic web browser made for the Xbox Game Bar on Windows 10.

This web browser is really basic but one didn't exist for the Xbox Game Bar at the time, so it's better than nothing. I expect a superior web browser to appear in the coming months but this repo is open to suggestions.

Currently, this browser uses the EdgeHTML WebView as it was the easiest to implement. If this app actually gains some popularity, I'll consider trying to implement Gecko or Chromium.

## Current features
- URL
- Bing search (as it was the easiest to implement)
- Home page
- Back a page
- Forward a page
- Refresh
- Pin to screen (part of Xbox Game Bar but it's still a pretty cool feature)
